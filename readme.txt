Use IP.Board to manage your comments.

== Description ==

IP.Board Comments for WordPress allows you to use IPB (IP.Board or Invision Power Board) to replace or enhance your WordPress comments. When a new WordPress post is created in a mapped category, it will cross-post to your IPB forum with a link back to the WordPress post. The IPB forum link is saved in a custom field and will appear in the footer of your post.

You may find it much easier to manage comments and users on the forum, rather than using the minimal WordPress comment system.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `ipb-comments-for-wordpress.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. In the IPB Comments menu, enter the Base Url and Base Path to your forums.
4. Enter the Member ID from your IPB forum to post as.
5. Enter IPB category numbers that match your existing WordPress categories.
