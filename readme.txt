Use IP.Board to manage your comments.

== Description ==

IP.Board Comments is a WordPress customization to allow you to use Invision Power Board or IP.Board to manage your WordPress comments. When a new post is made in WordPress, if the category is one of those mapped to an IPB category, it will cross-post the content to your IPB forum. At the same time, it will add a link to your WordPress post containing the url to join the discussion in progress. A forum link will also appear in your forum topic to read the full story. You may find it much easier to manage comments and users on the forum, rather than using the minimal WordPress comment system.

Please fork and update the code with suggested improvements.

== Installation ==

You can now use the WordPress Settings > IPB Comments menu to map the forum categories to your WordPress categories, and enter the required information.

1. Upload `ipb-comments.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
